## Introduction
OpenVision is an AI-powered assistant designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating urban African environments. The project uses object detection, text-to-speech (TTS), and language translation technologies to provide real-time navigation assistance and support for low-resource African languages. Built for CodeXtreme Hackathon, OpenVision aims to bridge the accessibility gap and empower visually impaired individuals to move independently and confidently.

## Problem Statement
In many African urban environments, infrastructure often lacks accessibility features for visually impaired individuals. Challenges include:
- **Obstacles:** Potholes, open gutters, and uneven surfaces.
- **Navigation:** Lack of accessible street signs and directions.
- **Language Barriers:** Limited support for low-resource African languages in existing assistive technologies.

OpenVision addresses these challenges by providing real-time obstacle detection, navigation assistance, and language translation.

## Solution Overview
OpenVision combines the following technologies:
- **Object Detection:** Detects obstacles (e.g., potholes, open gutters) and objects (e.g., street signs, vehicles) using a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Provides real-time audio feedback in English and low-resource African languages.
- **Language Translation:** Translates detected text (e.g., street signs) into local languages.
- **A mobile App:** An app that uses the device's camera and microphone for real-time assistance.

## Features
### Real-Time Obstacle Detection:
- Detects potholes, open gutters, street signs, vehicles, and more.
- Provides audio feedback to alert users of obstacles.

### Navigation Assistance:
- Guides users through urban environments using audio instructions.
- Integrates with GPS for route planning.

### Language Translation:
- Translates detected text (e.g., street signs) into local languages.
- Supports low-resource African languages (e.g., Yoruba, Swahili).

### Accessible App:
- Works on mobile devices with a simple, intuitive interface.
- Uses the device's camera and microphone for real-time assistance.

## Technical Architecture
### The OpenVision system consists of the following components:
#### **Object Detection Model:**
- **Model:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once).
- **Backbone:** ResNet-101 for feature extraction.
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset of African urban environments (potholes, street signs, etc.). 

#### **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
- **Library:** Google TTS (gTTS) for English.
- **Low-Resource Languages:** Coqui TTS for African languages.

#### **Language Translation:**
- **Model:** Fine-tuned MarianMT for low-resource African languages.
- **Supported Languages:** Yoruba, Swahili, Hausa, etc.

#### **App:**
- **Framework:** Flutter.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Python, OpenCV, PyTorch.

## Dataset and Model Training
### **Dataset**
- **Source:** Collected from African urban environments, including potholes, street signs, vehicles, and pedestrians. https://universe.roboflow.com/all-mix/visually-impaired-dataset
- **Annotation:** Labeled using Roboflow and LabelImg.
- **Classes:** Potholes, open gutters, street signs, vehicles, pedestrians, etc.

### **Model Training**
#### **YOLOv8 Fine-Tuning:**
- Pretrained on COCO dataset.
- Fine-tuned on the custom African urban dataset.
- Achieved mAP50 of 0.492 and mAP50-95 of 0.332.

#### **Language Translation:**
- Fine-tuned MarianMT on low-resource African language datasets.
- Achieved BLEU scores of 25+ for Yoruba and Swahili.

## Model Improvements
- **Improved Object Detection:** Added more classes (e.g., traffic lights, animals).
- **Increased Dataset Size and Diversity:** Achieved higher mAP by training for more epochs.
- **Low-Resource Language Support:** Fine-tuned TTS models for African languages using Coqui TTS.
- **Optimized Inference Speed:** Using ONNX and TensorRT, reduced latency to <100ms per frame.

## App Development
The app is built using Flask and provides the following features:
- **Real-Time Video Feed:** Displays the camera feed with detected objects highlighted.
- **Audio Feedback:** Provides real-time audio alerts for detected objects.
- **Language Translation:** Translates detected text into local languages.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for visually impaired users.

## Challenges and Learnings
### **Challenges**
- **Dataset Collection:** Limited availability of labeled datasets for African urban environments.
- **Low-Resource Languages:** Lack of high-quality datasets for African languages.
- **Real-Time Performance:** Balancing accuracy and inference speed.

### **Learnings**
- **Importance of Dataset Diversity:** A diverse dataset improves model generalization.
- **Fine-Tuning for Local Context:** Pretrained models need fine-tuning for specific use cases.
- **User-Centric Design:** Accessibility features are critical for visually impaired users.

## Future Work
- **Expand Object Detection:** Add more classes (e.g., animals, traffic lights).
- **Improve Language Support:** Add more African languages (e.g., Zulu, Igbo).
- **Mobile App Development:** Develop a standalone mobile app for easier access.
- **Integration with Wearable Devices:** Build a wearable device for hands-free navigation.
